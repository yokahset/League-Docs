## Intro

Why hello there! It seems you're back in the Rule-Book, huh?
Below you will find the league's rules, and a bit about the History of this wonderful League. 
Please read carefully, as you'll be required to know this information for your SAT tests, if you ever want to get into a good University, and play Fantasy full time. 

You'll find a revision date at the top of the document, and a link to access the previous versions, including change logs if you're just looking for what's new. 
For any questions about the league rules, please contact the Commissioner(s). 

## Buy-Ins, Stakes, & Winnings 

This League is about the pure unbridled love for the game. 
Our buy in is time and effort. 
Our stakes are peer admiration and jealousy.
Our winnings are eternal bragging rights of being better than all your friends at something they care deeply about being good at. 
This League is about never knowing if a phone-call is just checking in on you, or trying to swindle your best players away in a trade. 

This League plays for Fantastic Fantasy Football Friendships.

## Contact Your Local Commissioner

For **anything** you need a commissioners input for or help with, please contact **both commissioners.**
Your commissioners lead opposite time schedule lives across different time-zones.
While one commissioner is asleep the other is likely wide-eyed with insomnia waiting for something to do.
It gets you help faster and it helps us stay on the same page so we both know you were having an issue. 

If it is a general issue, feel free to tag us in the league chat. 
If it's a sensitive issue, please message us on sleeper, email us, or text us. 
Our contact information wil be provided to everyone via a league email as this rulebook will be publicly posted online. 

If you are missing our contact information, please contact either of us on sleeper and we'll get you sorted.

The draft order is determined by the team with the lowest "Points For" at the end of the season. 
This tally includes bench and taxi players and is designed as an anti tanking method. 
The rookie draft itself is a standard linear rookie draft with a third round reversal.

#### Third Round Reversal 

The third round of the rookie draft is reversed. 
The owner of the natural 3.01 will have the 3.10, and the 3.10 natural owner will have the 3.01. 
Other picks inside will be changed to match the format. 

### Divisions 

We do not use divisions at this time. 



## Rules

### Have Fun, Be Kind, Compete

We know we don't need to tell you how to act, but...
You know how to be polite, you know how to be respectful while shit-talking, and you know how to set your lineups on time. 
Use your head, make smart decisions, and act in a way that fosters the growth and success of both your own team and the league itself.

When it doubt, remember W.A.F.F.L.E.O. (We're All Friends, Friends Love Each Other).
Let's act like it. 

### Spirit of the Law

We operate by both the expressed letter of the law, and the spirit of the law. 
If there is a loop hole that you are exploiting that is not specifically stated, yet you know it's sneaky and it's clearly a loophole; **it is not legal.**
We will not be engaging in debates of syntax, phrasing, definitions, semantics, or pedantry. 
If you are in some way manipulating the platform or rulebook to gain an advantage and you are asked to stop; **Stop.**


### Keep It Legal 

During the season, you are expected to keep a legal roster at all times. 
Sleeper will prevent you from setting your lineup if your roster is not legal. 
**Your lineup must be legal before any of the games start.** 
If you make a trade or other action occurs that puts your lineup in an illegal state, please do your best to correct the roster promptly. 
When gaining extra players on a trade, please remember to factor in your cut players as items you will need to deal with when they make your roster illegal. 

We want to avoid people setting their lineup before a week starts and carrying extra players who are coming off IR, or in some other way giving that player an advantage.
Please be sure to regularly check in on your lineup during the season to make sure that it's in a legal and operable state. 
It is best for the competitive health of the league if your lineup is set properly. 

### Full and Complete Lineup 

You are expected to roster a full and complete lineup for every week's match. 
That means one player, who is playing a match that week, in every spot listed in your starting roster. 
We do not allow incomplete rosters, for the gaming of rosters by removing K/DST when your team is guaranteed a win if it does not lose points. 
Please play a full lineup every single week, every single game. 

We understand that there may be times where due to roster constraints, injuries, and bye weeks that a legal roster may not be possible without jeopardizing your team.
We ask that if such an occurrence happens, you let the commissioners know.
Special circumstances, such as this one example, may be allowed at the commissioners joint discretion .


### The Commissioners Clause

Our role as commissioners is to garden the league for its own health and growth. 
In this role we reserve the right to make considerate judgments about the rules and operation of the league.
These judgments may cover areas which are not explicitly spelled out in the rulebook. 
While these decisions are usually minor, we do reserve the right to an iron fist when appropriate and necessary. 
In the history of this league, we have yet to see anything come close to or approach the need for heavy handed commissioner intervention.

Nothing will be operating any different than it has been in the last 5 seasons in this regard.

### Positional Player Hoarding

There are no rules against hoarding collections of a specific position. 
You are still under your full obligation to field a legal lineup every single week, and no exceptions will be granted when your choices impact that ability. 

### Trade Vetoing 

The Commissioner(s) have the sole reasonable discretion to veto any trade detrimental to the integrity of the League. 
Only one trade veto has been levied in the history of the league, and was not done so lightly. 
We are a no interference league;
Nobody knows how a trade will turn out. 
Something that seems balanced could be lop-sided, something that seems lop-sided could be balanced. 
Trades will not be vetoed unless there is an issue that presents itself.  

PENDING TRADES can be cancelled if ALL the involved parties contact the Commissioner(s) and ask for it to be cancelled. 

For any an all concerns about trades you believe harm the League, please contact your Commissioner(s).


### Trade Processing Time 

After a trade has been agreed upon by each party, and the app accepts it, the trade will process for two days before transferring the assets.
This deadline is to ensure the Commissioner(s) have had time to see the trade and verify it does not harm the League.
Once the Commissioner(s) have seen the trade and approved it, they have the option of approving the processing of that trade early, waiving the two day wait. 
The purpose of waiving the two-day wait is to alleviate irrelevant roster holds that may occur needlessly.

**Trades made Between Football Sunday, and the conclusion of the following Monday, will NOT be processed early.** 
This creates too many potentially competitive advantages and is too messy to wander into. 

**DO NOT EXPECT YOUR TRADE TO BE PROCESSED EARLY, NOR MAKE TRADES ASSUMING EXPEDITED PROCESSING WILL OCCUR.**

Life is busy, and every trade is unique and special.
Sometimes it may take a while to get joint-Commissioner approval, or it may be competitively unfair to approve a trade early. 
Again, the reasoning is that there are some cases where a two day wait is nonsensical and could be reduced.
Those are the cases in which expedited approval is POSSIBLE, but NOT guaranteed.


For any and all questions about this policy, contact your Commissioner(s) before, during, or after the trade!

# Rule Change Process

All essential rules will be voted on by the members of the league. 
Rules can be classified into a few different categories. 
The examples are not exhaustive.

1. Class 1 rules. 
   1. Format changes, Roster changes, creation of rules, major changes, etc 
2. Class 2 rules 
   1. Trade deadlines, waiver rules, scoring changes, sleeper features, etc. 
3. Class 3 rules
   1. Roster legal dates, draft dates, mid-season rule clarification, business handling. 

## Class 1 Rules

These rules require a supermajority of owners to vote for them to pass. 
A supermajority in our league would be at least 8/10 members voting yes. 
These rules are often significant enough that they cannot be implemented in the same league year as the approval of the change. 
Some rules may be implemented in following seasons if they significantly impact strategy and require planning around that.

## Class 2 Rules 

These rules require a simple majority of owners to vote for them to pass. 
A simple majority in our league would be at least 6 /10 owners voting yes.

## Class 3 Rules

These rules do not require any owner vote to pass.
Instead both commissioners must agree to pass the rule. 
These rules are intended to be administrative, clarifying, logistical, or otherwise **necessary** to continue smooth operation of the league. 

Class 3 rules may be used to interpret or clarify rules when issues in the league arise. 
If these rulings affect a class 1 or 2 rule in a material way, the issue will be voted on during the next voting session to cement a permanent change.

## Rule Changes 

At the conclusion of the fantasy season, the commissioners will announce the off-season schedule.
Included will be a date for submissions of new rules or rule changes to the league, and a date for voting day.
These will be submitted on sleeper or a communicated external platform. 
If the rule submissions are determined by the commissioners to not cause harm to the league, they will be classified and passed to the league in the voting session. 

### Dependant Rules 

Some rule changes may require multiple sections to be voted on.
For example, a two part question of "Should we change scoring away from PPR? (Y/N)" would also require a subsequent vote of "Should we change to .5ppr, 0ppr, etc."
In the case of a 'two-parter' rule, each option should be included in the voting session as to avoid a follow-up vote over specifics of the new measure. 
If a rule requires additional votes, these will be added by the commissioners as "Rule X, Rule X.1, Rule X.2, Rule X.3" votes.
League owners should vote for sub-rules under the assumption that the main rule passes, **even if they are voting against it.** 

## Rule Suggestions

We would encourage each member to submit any rule changes they have during the suggestion period. 
If you do **not have any changes to suggest**, I would still welcome any suggestions you may have to improve the league or things we can clarify. 
At any point in the season you are welcome to message the commissioners a rule suggestion and we will add it to next year's agenda so you don't forget.

While there is no expressed limit of how many rules you may suggest, please keep the amount considerate and appropriate. 
We do not need 30 rule changes submitted per person. 

## New Owner Process

Everyone submits one owner 
If not all members submit an owner, we ask for additional suggestions from owners who have submitted. 

If no new league mate is chosen, we will look for a caretaker oof the team.
If no suitable caretaker is found, the roster will be hybernated with a new game played against league median as a replacement.
The hybernated team will not compete but will inherit a pick determined by a lottery between picks 1.01 and 1.05. 
The lottery will be held at the start of the season prior to games starting. 

## New candidate process 

When it comes to selecting new candidates, we want to pick individuals that match the calibre we have in the league currently. 
These people should be enthusiastic about football, eager to compete, and ready to interact with the league and its members. 
Three things we're looking for are:

1. Fantasy football experience and mindset
2. Schedule and commitment availability 
3. Personality fit with current leaguemates 

## Approval process

When it comes time for new owners, we want the new owner process to be as streamlined as possible. 

1. Leaguemates each submit one new potential owner.
   1. If a league member does not have a suggestion, we may accept multiple from other owners.
2. Applicants fill out the information and experience survey.
3. Commissioners review paperwork for the best fits.
4. Commissioners will reach out to candidates to speak with them about joining the league.
5. Commissioners will unanimously select the top candidates to submit to the league for a vote. 
6. The vote will need a super majority of the remaining members to elect a new owner into the league. 
   1. For a 9 person vote, it would be 7 yes votes. 
   2. The vote will happen by ranked choice voting, meaning you will rank each candidate from your most preferred to least preferred choice.
   3. This is done so we can avoid additional votes upon ties, or other reasons to re-poll. 
7. If for some reason there are no suitable applicants, or no applicants pass the threshold, the cycle will start over. 

## New Member Probation 

Each newly appointed owner will be subject to a one season probation policy. 
If at the end of the first season there is a determination made that their fit in the league is harmful to normal conduct, the owner will be removed from the league. 


## Calendar

Below is an outlined list of important dates for the league. 
The dates, and summary explanation will be listed below, and a Google Calendar will be provided via email of those dates so you can add them to your preferred Calendar manager.
Any major modification to the league calendar will require a simple majority vote. 

### End of Season Roster Lock

After the final championship game of the season ends, the rosters will lock completely. 
This means that your final lineup for championship week **will be the lineup you are taking into the off-season.**
Week 16 is the date currently set for our championship game. 

### Off-Season Legal Rosters

Rosters must be attended to and legal by the **first of May**.
This means, by 11:59 in April, your roster must match Sleeper, or a future platforms, requirements for the league settings. 
For specifics on what constitutes a legal roster, please see 'Roster Legality' in the Rules section. 
Please do this in a timely fashion, and notify the commissioner when you have done so.
This will let us open on time, and not delay the other members.

### Season Start Roster Unlock

The league rosters will unlock two days after the Off-Season Legal Roster date. 
The current unlock date is set for May 3rd.
This delay will give the Commissioner(s) time to ensure the legality of each roster, and account for any issues. 
If the rosters are legal and verified before May 3rd, the rosters may be unlocked early, with 24 hour notice, at the discretion of the Commissioner's joint opinion. 

**The rosters MAY NOT be unlocked while a team is illegally rostered.**
If rosters are not legal by the correct date, and still illegal by the opening date, remedial action may be taken to open the league to open the league as soon as possible. 
This action may include dropping player(s) from the roster to fit compliance.
Please refer to the 'Remedial Actions' section in the rules for more detail. 

### Open Trading

Trading begins again at the start of the Roster Unlock date, May 3rd. 
The opening of Trading will depend on rosters being legally set, but may in some cases be opened at the discretion of the Commissioner(s). 
**If trading is opened, and your lineup is NOT LEGAL, you will NOT be allowed to be party to any trades until your roster has become legal.**

### Draft

The Rookie Draft will be held during the first week of the NFL Pre-Season, colloquially known as "Hall of Fame Week."
Please refer to the attached league calender for this year's specific dates. 
Currently, Hall of Fame Week is the first week of August.

There will be a backup date for the draft set in case of an emergency cancellation, which will be the second week of the NFL pre-season. 

Drafts are notoriously hard to schedule, and because of this, we ask you to make a good faith effort to keep the Friday evening and the weekend days open during these periods for us to decide on a draft time as soon as possible, though the draft could be on any day agreed upon in that week.
We understand life is messy and scheduling is difficult, and we would like to lock in dates that work for everyone while leaving flexibility for emergencies. 
We hope to find a time each member can be fully present during the draft and engaged with our fellow league-mates.


### Trade Deadline

The Trade Deadline is after Week 10 of the NFL season.
This date was two weeks after the NFL's trade deadline, but due to the NFL Schedule change, is now a week after.
Trading in any capacity will not be allowed after the Tuesday following that week's Monday Night Football game. 
Trading will not re-open until the Open Trading date, covered above. 

### Roster Locking

Rosters will lock at the conclusion of the League's Championship Game.
This means the roster you have going into the title game **WILL BE THE ONE YOU CLOSE THE YEAR WITH.**
There is no add/drop period after our title game, despite the two weeks of NFL football left. 
Your roster must be legal before the title game, and if your roster is illegal, and locked, remedial actions will be taken to legalize the roster. 

### League Mixer?

This bit is mostly a placeholder for an in-progress idea:

My favorite part of this league is getting to engage with all of the people here. After all, we are the Fantastic Fantasy Football **FRIENDS,** and I deeply enjoy that aspect.
I would love to see us do a virtual / in-person hybrid mixer in the future where we can gather before the season or the draft and chit-chat as a League. 
I think a good time for this would be post NFL Draft, Pre-Fantasy Draft.
