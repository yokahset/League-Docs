## Intro

Why hello there! It seems you're back in the Rule-Book, huh?
Below you will find the league's rules, and a bit about the History of this wonderful League. 
Please read carefully, as you'll be required to know this information for your SAT tests, if you ever want to get into a good University, and play Fantasy full time. 

You'll find a revision date at the top of the document, and a link to access the previous versions, including change logs if you're just looking for what's new. 
For any questions about the league rules, please contact the Commissioner(s). 

## Buy-Ins, Stakes, & Winnings 

This League is about the pure unbridled love for the game. 
Our buy in is time and effort. 
Our stakes are peer admiration and jealousy.
Our winnings are eternal bragging rights of being better than all your friends at something they care deeply about being good at. 
This League is about never knowing if a phone-call is just checking in on you, or trying to swindle your best players away in a trade. 

This League plays for Fantastic Fantasy Football Friendships.

## Rules

### Trade Vetoing 

The Commissioner(s) have the sole reasonable discretion to veto any trade detrimental to the integrity of the League. 
Only one trade veto has been levied in the history of the league, and was not done so remotely lightly. 
We are a no interference league;
Nobody knows how a trade will turn out. 
Something that seems balanced could be lop-sided, something that seems lop-sided could be balanced. 
Trades will not be vetoed unless there is an issue that presents itself.  

PENDING TRADES can be cancelled if ALL the involved parties contact the Commissioner(s) and ask for it to be cancelled. 

For any an all concerns about trades you believe harm the League, please contact your Commissioner(s).


### Trade Processing Time 

After a trade has been agreed upon by each party, and the app accepts it, the trade will process for two days before transferring the assets.
This deadline is to ensure the Commissioner(s) have had time to see the trade and verify it does not harm the League.
Once the Commissioner(s) have seen the trade and approved it, they have the option of approving the processing of that trade early, waiving the two day wait. 
The purpose of waiving the two-day wait is to alleviate irrelevant roster holds that may occur needlessly.

**Trades made Between Football Sunday, and the conclusion of the following Monday, will NOT be processed early.** 
This creates too many potentially competitive advantages and is too messy to wander into. 

**DO NOT EXPECT YOUR TRADE TO BE PROCESSED EARLY, NOR MAKE TRADES ASSUMING EXPEDITED PROCESSING WILL OCCUR.**

Life is busy, and every trade is unique and special.
Sometimes it may take a while to get joint-Commissioner approval, or it may be competitively unfair to approve a trade early. 
Again, the reasoning is that there are some cases where a two day wait is nonsensical and could be reduced.
Those are the cases in which expedited approval is POSSIBLE, but NOT guaranteed.


For any and all questions about this policy, contact your Commissioner(s) before, during, or after the trade!

# Rule Change Process

## New Owner Process




## Calendar

Below is an outlined list of important dates for the league. 
The dates, and summary explanation will be listed below, and a Google Calendar will be provided of those dates so you can add them to your preferred Calendar manager.
Any major modification to the league calendar will require a simple majority vote. 

### End of Season Roster Lock

After the final championship game of the season ends, the rosters will lock completely. 
This means that your final lineup for championship week **will be the lineup you are taking into the off-season.**
Week 16 is the date currently set for our championship game. 

### Off-Season Legal Rosters

Rosters must be attended to and legal by the **first of May**.
This means, by 11:59 in April, your roster must match Sleeper, or a future platforms, requirements for the league settings. 
For specifics on what constitutes a legal roster, please see 'Roster Legality' in the Rules section. 
Please do this in a timely fashion, and notify the commissioner when you have done so.
This will let us open on time, and not delay the other members.

### Season Start Roster Unlock

The league rosters will unlock two days after the Off-Season Legal Roster date. 
The current unlock date is set for May 3rd.
This delay will give the Commissioner(s) time to ensure the legality of each roster, and account for any issues. 
If the rosters are legal and verified before May 3rd, the rosters may be unlocked early, with 24 hour notice, at the discretion of the Commissioner's joint opinion. 

**The rosters MAY NOT be unlocked while a team is illegally rostered.**
If rosters are not legal by the correct date, and still illegal by the opening date, remedial action may be taken to open the league to open the league as soon as possible. 
This action may include dropping player(s) from the roster to fit compliance.
Please refer to the 'Remedial Actions' section in the rules for more detail. 

### Open Trading

Trading begins again at the start of the Roster Unlock date, May 3rd. 
The opening of Trading will depend on rosters being legally set, but may in some cases be opened at the discretion of the Commissioner(s). 
**If trading is opened, and your lineup is NOT LEGAL, you will NOT be allowed to be party to any trades until your roster has become legal.**

### Draft

The Rookie Draft will be held during the first week of the NFL Pre-Season, colloquially known as "Hall of Fame Week."
Please refer to the attached league calender for this year's specific dates. 
Currently, Hall of Fame Week is the first week of August.

There will be a backup date for the draft set in case of an emergency cancellation, which will be the second week of the NFL pre-season. 

Drafts are notoriously hard to schedule, and because of this, we ask you to make a good faith effort to keep the Friday evening and the weekend days open during these periods for us to decide on a draft time as soon as possible, though the draft could be on any day agreed upon in that week.
We understand life is messy and scheduling is difficult, and we would like to lock in dates that work for everyone while leaving flexibility for emergencies. 
We hope to find a time each member can be fully present during the draft and engaged with our fellow league-mates.


### Trade Deadline

The Trade Deadline is after Week 10 of the NFL season.
This date was two weeks after the NFL's trade deadline, but due to the NFL Schedule change, is now a week after.
Trading in any capacity will not be allowed after the Tuesday following that week's Monday Night Football game. 
Trading will not re-open until the Open Trading date, covered above. 

### Roster Locking

Rosters will lock at the conclusion of the League's Championship Game.
This means the roster you have going into the title game **WILL BE THE ONE YOU CLOSE THE YEAR WITH.**
There is no add/drop period after our title game, despite the two weeks of NFL football left. 
Your roster must be legal before the title game, and if your roster is illegal, and locked, remedial actions will be taken to legalize the roster. 

### League Mixer?

This bit is mostly a placeholder for an in-progress idea:

My favorite part of this league is getting to engage with all of the people here. After all, we are the Fantastic Fantasy Football **FRIENDS,** and I deeply enjoy that aspect.
I would love to see us do a virtual / in-person hybrid mixer in the future where we can gather before the season or the draft and chit-chat as a League. 
I think a good time for this would be post NFL Draft, Pre-Fantasy Draft. 


## Misc

### Championship Teams 

I think this section should include a bit about the team that won the league that year, a little of what happened in the NFL, and a quote from the champ.
